# REDS ( Realistic Experiment Design Suite)

Neuroscientists regularly use simple visual and auditory stimuli for understanding the brain. The need for lifelike experiment environments is a real necessity in this field. Using 3D virtual environments, neuroscientists can design and analyze experiments in more challenging tasks and more similar to real environment situations. Previously, suite of software tools for designing 3D virtual environments such as NEDE and USE has been reported. However, simplicity of the environments used in these tools, the specificity of the hardware required for the task has made them difficult to use.

 
REDS (Realistic Experiments Design Suite) https://www.reds-lab.com is a suite to design lifelike virtual environment to use in neuroscience experiments. The proposed method is built on a free, powerful and flexible game engine, Unity3D. It employs simple Unity tools, and enables researchers to design various near real-life 3D environments. This tool can be synchronized with several eye tracker systems. By minimizing existing methods restrictions, researchers can easily put objects on any place of the environment without any constraints. In addition, subjects are able to move freely as a first person character. Another novel feature of the proposed method is the ability to calculate the area of interest for each object and eye tracking features at any time.
